Its diversity is reflected in Toronto\u2019s ethnic neighborhoods such as Chinatown, Corso Italia, Greektown, Kensington Market, Koreatown, Little India, Little Italy, Little Jamaica, Little Portugal & Roncesvalles.\nIn this project we will go through step by step process to make a decision on a good place to open a restaurant. We analyze the neighborhoods in Toronto to identify the most profitable area by using the income and population of each neighborhoods since the success of the restaurant depends on the people and ambience. \n\n                                                             DATA\nData sources:\na) I\u2019m using \u201cList of Postal code of Canada: M\u201d (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M) wiki page to get all the information about the neighborhoods present in Toronto.
